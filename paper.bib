                 self-diffusion tensor, Deff, are related to the echo intensity

                 design experiments from which Deff is estimated. This estimate
                 is validated using isotropic and anisotropic media, i.e.,
                 water and skeletal muscle. It is shown that significant errors
                 are made in diffusion NMR spectroscopy and imaging of
                 anisotropic skeletal muscle when off-diagonal elements of Deff

                 quantifying the degree to which water diffusion in biologic
                 tissues is non-Gaussian. Since tissue structure is responsible
                 for the deviation of water diffusion from the Gaussian
                 behavior typically observed in homogeneous solutions, this
                 method provides a specific measure of tissue structure, such
                 as cellular compartments and membranes. The method is an
                 extension of conventional diffusion-weighted imaging that
                 requires the use of somewhat higher b values and a modified
                 image postprocessing procedure. In addition to the diffusion
                 coefficient, the method provides an estimate for the excess
                 kurtosis of the diffusion displacement probability
                 distribution, which is a dimensionless metric of the departure
                 from a Gaussian form. From the study of six healthy adult
                 subjects, the excess diffusional kurtosis is found to be

                 parameters, however, depend on the diffusion weighting
                 strength, the b-value, which hampers the interpretation and

                 this study, a likelihood ratio test is used to show that the

                 a result, the diffusion kurtosis imaging model provides a

                 excess kurtosis, which is a dimensionless measure for the
                 deviation of water diffusion profile from Gaussian
                 distribution. Several recent studies have applied DKI to probe
                 the restricted water diffusion in biological tissues. The
                 directional analysis has also been developed to obtain the
                 directionally specific kurtosis. However, these studies could
                 not directly evaluate the sensitivity of DKI in detecting
                 subtle neural tissue alterations. Brain maturation is known to
                 involve various biological events that can affect water
                 diffusion properties, thus providing a sensitive platform to
                 evaluate the efficacy of DKI. In this study, in vivo DKI
                 experiments were performed in normal Sprague-Dawley rats of 3
                 different ages: postnatal days 13, 31 and 120 (N=6 for each
                 group). Regional analysis was then performed for 4 white
                 matter (WM) and 3 gray matter (GM) structures. Diffusivity and
                 kurtosis estimates derived from DKI were shown to be highly
                 sensitive to the developmental changes in these chosen
                 structures. Conventional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
                 parameters were also computed using monoexponential model,
                 yielding reduced sensitivity and directional specificity in
                 monitoring the brain maturation changes. These results
                 demonstrated that, by measuring directionally specific
                 diffusivity and kurtosis, DKI offers a more comprehensive and
                 sensitive detection of tissue microstructural changes. Such
                 imaging advance can provide a better MR diffusion
                 characterization of neural tissues, both WM and GM, in normal,
